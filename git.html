FOR YOUR AVERAGE DUDE<br />
<br />
step zero:<br />
WHY<br />
because sending zips between people is what cavemen do. we are in the twenty-first century and if i get another bastard trying to make me manually merge two projects just to add one object i will probably shoot myself in the head<br />
i'm sure your pals will appreciate it as well.<br />
you might think that this is something reserved for programmers, but git is very useful to those in other roles as well.<br />
sending images and music over discord is functional and all but cmon<br />
wouldn't it be nice if you could press one button and immediately download everyone's changes, and every version of them?<br />
well THAT'S why i'm here<br />
<br />
git is a fancy technology that lets you save and upload changes to files, instead of the whole file itself. once a file is tracked by git, saving it doesn't make a record of the entire thing, just of what is different between the last time you saved it and this time. because of this, it's incredibly lightweight and you save a lot of space both locally and when uploading.<br />
multiple people can work on the same project, and since they're only uploading their "changes" instead of an entire file, as long as those changes don't contradict eachother, they can be consolidated into a functioning project that you can keep working on automaticallly.<br />
in general this is called source control, and git is just one rendition of the idea, but it's pretty damn widely used, and it's the only one i've worked with. if you wanna use mercurial that's up to you<br />
<br />
step one: <a href="https://git-scm.com">https://git-scm.com</a><br />
install it.<br />
there will be a lot of options on the installer, if any of them matter to you do whatever, otherwise just keep clicking forward until you're done.<br />
got it? great.<br />
<br />
step two: <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a><br />
make an account. secure password. whatever.<br />
there's a cool chart that displays whenever you do commits (uploads). you can see mine at <a href="https://github.com/XanderAeon">https://github.com/XanderAeon</a><br />
try to make yours as cool.<br />
<br />
step three:<br />
get a repository.<br />
if you're making a new repo hit the arrow in the top right of github and make it.<br />
from there, you will be presented with a screen that says CLONE WITH THIS and a big link.<br />
if you're using a repository that already exists, hit the green CODE button and grab that link.<br />
regardless, hold onto it. we will use it shortly.<br />
<br />
step four:<br />
get a client.<br />
<br />
step four point one (optional):<br />
well technically you don't need a client you can just do the following sequence of events instead after having installed git and navigated to the path of the repository<br />
git clone [link] (copies repo into folder)<br />
git pull (acquire changes from github)<br />
git add -A (prepares all changed files for a commit)<br />
git commit -m [commit message] (saves the file changes)<br />
git push (pushes saves to github)<br />
but if you're here its probably because you know that sucks<br />
<br />
REAL step four:<br />
you have two options.<br />
sourcetree (<a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">https://www.sourcetreeapp.com</a>)<br />
and gitkraken (<a href="https://www.gitkraken.com">https://www.gitkraken.com</a>)<br />
and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. especially not github.<br />
sourcetree: totally free, open source, runs well, bad at merging, bad at cloning<br />
gitkraken: free unless the project is hosted in a private repo, chromium (bad), really good at merging, looks pretty, has trello or some shit built in idk<br />
i like gitkraken but my free student edition ran out so i'm on sourcetree right now. still pretty good.<br />
the only thing you need to worry about while installing either is linking your github account so it has the correct credentials and knows where to push<br />
also sourcetree tries to make you use bitbucket or mercurial or something stupid, just skip past all of that<br />
<br />
step five:<br />
learn the words.<br />
"repository" (repo) - a directory containing git data alongside a project<br />
"commit" - make a backup of the changes between the last commit and the present. any commit can be accessed any time<br />
"stage" - to prepare a file to be committed<br />
"push" - upload commits to repository host so that other users may pull them<br />
"pull" - download latest commits from the repo host<br />
"branch" - a thread of updates stemming from some origin. multiple of these allow multiple variants of the project to be updated<br />
"clone" - to download a repo with its git data<br />
<br />
step six:<br />
GET YOUR REPO AND START GOING<br />
in whichever client you're using, find a big ol button that says CLONE<br />
hit it, drop that link from before in as the source, and pick somewhere on your computer as the destination.<br />
once you hit clone, that place will be a git repository and will automatically pick up any file changes that are made in there.<br />
in your client, it'll also open a big area with a timeline of commits and changed files on the right (gitkraken) or in the file status menu (sourcetree).<br />
you're basically good to go by this point. to start committing just change or add some files, and they'll show up in the unstaged area. hit stage, enter a message in the commit box, and you've made your commit backup save thing.<br />
hit "push" to make the changes visible to other users of the repository, and "pull" to acquire the changes of others.<br />
if there are things you haven't pulled yet, make sure you commit any changes before pulling, or it'll make a "stash", which is basically "hey i hid all of your changes since the last formal commit and this one so you could get fully synced with what youre pulling"<br />
if you wanna get your changes out of the stash, you gotta "pop" (or apply) it. right click it on the timeline or whatever and press that.<br />
<br />
step seven:<br />
in which i don't talk about merge conflicts so as to not scare anyone off.<br />
if you committed and then pulled and it says something is busted use your best judgement or google it or ask me on discord i'll try my best to help.<br />
its all much easier to resolve on gitkraken.<br />
<br />
<br />
