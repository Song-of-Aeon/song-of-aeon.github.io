FOR YOUR AVERAGE DUDE<br />
<br />
step one: <a href="https://git-scm.com">https://git-scm.com</a><br />
install it.<br />
there will be a lot of options on the installer, if any of them matter to you do whatever, otherwise just keep clicking forward until you're done.<br />
got it? great.<br />
<br />
step two: <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a><br />
make an account. secure password. whatever.<br />
there's a cool chart that displays whenever you do commits (uploads). you can see mine at <a href="https://github.com/XanderAeon">https://github.com/XanderAeon</a><br />
try to make yours as cool.<br />
<br />
step three:<br />
get a repository.<br />
if you're making a new repo hit the arrow in the top right of github and make it.<br />
from there, you will be presented with a screen that says CLONE WITH THIS and a big link.<br />
if you're using a repository that already exists, hit the green CODE button and grab that link.<br />
regardless, hold onto it. we will use it shortly.<br />
<br />
step four:<br />
get a client.<br />
<br />
step four point one (optional):<br />
well technically you don't need a client you can just do the following sequence of events instead after having installed git and navigated to the path of the repository<br />
git clone [link] (copies repo into folder)<br />
git pull (acquire changes from github)<br />
git add -A (prepares all changed files for a commit)<br />
git commit -m [commit message] (saves the file changes)<br />
git push (pushes saves to github)<br />
but if you're here its probably because you know that sucks<br />
<br />
REAL step four:<br />
you have two options.<br />
sourcetree (<a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">https://www.sourcetreeapp.com</a>)<br />
and gitkraken (<a href="https://www.gitkraken.com">https://www.gitkraken.com</a>)<br />
and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. especially not github.<br />
sourcetree: totally free, open source, runs well, bad at merging, bad at cloning<br />
gitkraken: free unless the project is hosted in a private repo, chromium (bad), really good at merging, looks pretty, has trello or some shit built in idk<br />
i like gitkraken but my free student edition ran out so i'm on sourcetree right now. still pretty good.<br />
the only thing you need to worry about while installing either is linking your github account so it has the correct credentials and knows where to push<br />
also sourcetree tries to make you use bitbucket or mercurial or something stupid, just skip past all of that<br />
<br />
step five:<br />
learn the words.<br />
"repository" (repo) - a directory containing git data alongside a project<br />
"commit" - make a backup of the changes between the last commit and the present. any commit can be accessed any time<br />
"stage" - to prepare a file to be committed<br />
"push" - upload commits to repository host so that other users may pull them<br />
"pull" - download latest commits from the repo host<br />
"branch" - a thread of updates stemming from some origin. multiple of these allow multiple variants of the project to be updated<br />
"clone" - to download a repo with its git data<br />
<br />
THE END<br />
