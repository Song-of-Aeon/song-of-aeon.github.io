"HOLY SHIT", i mean from the bottom of my heart because got damn that is a lot of gaming.<br />
i will respond to the post as i read it as always but i did skip randomly through it and it seems like you have played more fire emblem in less than half a year than i have in my entire life.<br /><br />
you may notice that you are not reading this on the lunatic red forums and instead on aeon-n.cool, my awesome new site. i mostly just do not want to have to struggle with the image upload limit and that bug that puts a bunch of line breaks in posts that have any embeds. also the thread is getting. substantially large.<br /><br />
<br />
alright lets go<br />
<br />
started on 1/7/13 at the same time? musta been<br />
jarring<br />
but also incredibly well-rounded and will prepare you for every other game in the series<br />
surprised you were not a fan of awakening's appearance since i consider the 3ds games to look the best by far outta any of the series<br />
the fidelity of sprites on the map that will immediately tell you what youre looking at with the variety of the 3d maps makin things look more than just like [castle tileset], [plains tileset], [desert tileset]<br />
although i will admit the 3d models of the fighters are not always the best<br />
<br />
fire emblem seven:<br />
its cool. i never beat it<br />
i really like the feel of the gba games but they have never seemed interesting enough to be worth enduring an entire game for since the only mechanic that really spices things up is rescue (i dont like rescue very much). most other games have some crazy things like pair up or battalions or [[[thracia]]] and i never really got in on the story much<br />
seein that valkyrie and<br />
>bolting<br />
hilarious and classic!<br />
i was also underprepared for seige tomes since awakening (my first game) has like two total<br />
and perhaps because of that i have never been a fan.<br />cheesy on both player and enemy side<br />
<br />
three and a half hours on one attempt! on god!<br />
yeah thats part of why i dont like the gba games. they look so tiny but they can be a slooog dude<br />
ill give three and a half hours to one map only (i will get to it later)<br />
<br />
cool final team! i am taking notes.<br />
<br />
all video game tutorials suck after knowing how to play except like<br />
ones that you can sequence break<br />
my condolences. they always have them starting at the gba games<br />
awesome secret: the tutorial chapters of three houses are more difficult than any other because you don't have rewind yet<br />
<br />
glad ya liked it. no more training wheels though huh straight to the og<br />
although ya liked it! cool i guess<br />
most of my info is from hearsay and half is from tsun so i can't comment too much with stuff other than "cant see unit ranges! stupid!" and "no skills! lame!"<br />
it mostly just looks annoying to play due to not having accumulated a couple decades of quality of life features<br />
"sheeda" huh i guess nobody uses the official names around here<br />
i might not have any place to speak but cmon<br />
caeda is way cooler<br />
<br />
massive fan of the jagen quote there<br />
<br />
anway its awakening time! i know that one<br />
HE DOESNT LIKE IT !<br />
i will put a crying image here later<br />
i got a lot ta say but ill just get it in order:<br />
the cast:<br />
so:<br />
the only fire emblem game i have played with a decent cast all the way around that isnt silent the entire ass time is tellius and awakening is not an exception. yes a bunch of them are very annoying and they say one thing a bunch. BUT there are some awesome ones and we got lowest lows highest highs in awakening. massive fan of owain, laslow, libra, robin (i am not trolling!), bastillo or whatever his name is, and some others<br />
<br />
lunatic plus huh! big party. awakening has a bit of a difficulty problem<br />
the problem: the start of the game is hard (or easy on things that arent lunatic) and then you unlock map battles<br />
and map battles tear every single fire emblem game that they exist in in half, nothing else to say<br />
everything goes out the window after that first risen fight<br />
awakening has a special case i will get to later but for any% that is true. just gotta be responsible i guess (bad design)<br />
i like your robin. normal girl. did you know its suboptimal to be a girl because men have children and robinsexuals and whatever whatever and also shes more annoying in some supports
i do not remember any same turn reinforcements even showing up in awakening so i musta got lucky. 99% sure they dont exist in fates. my condolences they are never acceptable<br />
<br />
henry is simply cracked thats all there is to it<br />
<br />
the prank weapons: awesome stuff. awakening and fates have massive weapon variety and you almost never have to use iron steel gold (boring). realized how awesome that was after playing three houses which has a total of two different weapons in the entire game and silver sword+ gets everything done<br />
<br />
ya beat the game congrats<br />
so im gonna tell ya somethin right<br />
awakening was not made for awakening. its all a big prank. the game gives you a billion regailia weapons for free. infinite exp grinding is allowed. dlc at any time. a massive cast. skill inheritance. its simply busted.<br />
but. as i have told tsun before.<br />
it exists for one map.<br />
apotheosis, the final dlc map, is BUSSIN MY GUY<br />
as far as i am concerned the only real goal of awakening is beating apotheosis and its secret route because ON GOD it is the best single fire emblem map<br />
its the only final map that has ever made me actually use everything ive gotten throughout the run. no ingenuity or preperation wasted. you bring your most insanely busted units and every single enemy is stronger than any one of your units. there is nothing like it.<br />
its hard to really describe how cool it is to have an insanely overpowered team and fight something stronger than you in the busted ass game that is awakening. this is the final boss:<br />
<img src="img/anna.png"><br />
she is surrounded by good friends and you have a turn limit (like five or something) to get over to her and beat her<br />
tsun has often iterated to me that the design philosophy behind kaga's fire emblems and their implementation of permadeath (lmao) was to have each player be able to tell their own story through gameplay that isn't forced on them by the game and is unique<br />
and i think this is a perfect culmination of that. by this point, every single unit is gonna be so customized their battlescars are told in their crit rate and their personality is on their sleeve in the form of skills. shits insane. cant even describe.<br />
<br />
fire emblem fates: the awesome one<br />
theres one thing youve gotta realize about the route picking my friend<br />
most people do not even have the six chapters. us two, we have the special edition whatever but you get this legitimately you pick your route at gamestop<br />
not terribly an informed decision! i think the intended choice is between selecting the good guys (hoshido) to want to win the war or thinking that you can redeem nohr because while the government sucks the people dont. this is a very interesting decision because iryuhfgnbsdkfjhsdifhujsdklfjklj and the internal affairs and individual stances on the war in nohr are more explored in the side manga starring leo called crown of nibelung of which i have the second volume. the art is great and an interpretation of corrin that isn't the protagonist is much more interesting and sidrfughjnsdglhusjdfnsikldghyufnj and there's a mod called "good guy garon" that rewrites all of the cutscenes in conquest to better represent nohr as a struggling nation and more justifies the war in that hoshido is blind to the geographical barrenness of nohr and considers them in the way that [[the vast majority of fire emblem fates the video game]] represents them as, an aggressive nation with cruel administrators.<br />
<br />
anyway the first six chapters are all varying levels of tutorial but they also give you a taste of what each route has and what you lose, mechanically, by picking one or the other.<br />
just kidding, you can access a shitload of nohrian stuff in birthright.<br />
in conquest its a bit more of a hassle to get your hands on hoshidan classes aside from like<br />
ninja<br />
very strong lookin corrin there. the manliness of his appearance belies his internal weakwilledness (im not talking about you i just mean the guy)<br />
did you know its suboptimal to be a boy because women have children and corrinsexuals and whatever whatever and jakob and also i think the female sprites look cooler<br />
too bad she has the stupid ass<br />
thigh hole<br />
anyway whatever you made it to chapter ten congrats<br />
i would not call it the best chapter in the series (apotheosis) or even the best chapter in conquest but its pretty cool, very sprawling.<br />
i am a big fan of almost all of the conquest chapters, especially the later ones people think are stupid<br />
my guy used all available resources! congrats, it doesnt happen nearly often enough. i hate ending a game with a ton of uses left on regalia just because the game never forced my hand. conquest does that a lot and if you were still playing it i would say to be careful with your rescues but too late<br />
<br />
and then you start the lategame conquest party. tons of fun. last time i played conquest (lunatic, like two years ago)<br />
wait<br />
i interrupt that sentence to say go d DAMN i havent beaten a good fire emblem game in at least two years. crimson rose and azure moon do not count. i should like. boot up tellius again huh<br />
anyway last time i played conquest i was takin it real slow you know ruminating on every single map (i do not (and couldnt really afford to) let units die) and playing intermittently i was getting like one chapter done every week or two<br />
i think this is a good thing since they are very tightly woven puzzle battles! very intricate and high quality<br />
<br />
no idea how you got so many assholes on the eternal staircase, i woulda gotten nuked way before that many spawned<br />
<br />
no idea how people can tell voice actors but thats fouckin slick i feel bad they gave a metal gear solid guy to >male corrin but right on<br />
all i know is that ryoma has the same voice actor as ((formerly the hero known as)) mcree from overwatch<br />
<br />
chapter 23 has trolled me in both of my runs the exact same way<br />     
five years ago or something i get to takumi and i will kill him but ho ho he has a seven percent crit! i will be fine even if it procs though im careful<br />
>vengeance<br />
such a shame! it would be awful if the exact same thing happened three years later in a lunatic run<br />
:[<br />
cool map though<br />
<br />
holy shit dude<br />
how do you take an EIGHT UNIT LOSS<br />
i said i dont let anyone die right but i know i can take one or two without softlocking myself<br />
but eight??? dead run right???<br />
i forget what difficulty you said you were on but im assuming hard since you did awakening on hard<br />
<br />
yeah dlc dosent give xp or gold unless you play the EXP OR GOLD MAPS??? stupid. i didnt use em<br />
as long as you dont cheese by selling stuff id say the vast majority of dlc is pretty fair to play a few times in any run though, a lot of the stuff is like side-grades and some of it is a TRAP like the grandmaster class. "Ah yes Grandmaster from Fire Emblem: Awakening! A spectacular class that excels at everything i will make my swordmaster a grandmaster." no. you do that and you die. every time i have had anyone be a grandmaster in fates they have shitted their balls off, mostly in speed and str. (rally spectrum is really good but leave the class asap after that)<br />
